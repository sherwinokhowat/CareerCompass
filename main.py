    # NOTE: to test the scraper, you may uncomment the following line. However, do
    # note that the scraper can take upwards to 5-10 minutes, so be prepared lol. Also,
    # the scraper overwrites the current jobs.csv file, so create a copy if  you wish
    # to keep the preloaded dataset prior the running the scraper. Also, please do not
    # have jobs.csv open for at least 10 seconds after the scraper is intially run to
    # prevent any file locking issues (csv may not write to it otherwise).
